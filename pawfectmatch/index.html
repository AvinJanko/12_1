        <em>Driven by an unwavering commitment to encourage 
        adoption over purchasing, <strong>Pawfect Match</strong> has been 
        successfully operating since its launch in 2003. Our 
        platform serves as a medium for pet lovers to find their 
        forever friend, and for our rescued animals to find their 
        forever home. To achieve our vision of a world without 
        abandoned pets or stray animals, we will continue 
        working hard to provide a new home, a new family, and a 
        new beginning for every animal in our care.</em>

          make. My home has become even livelier with you in it. 
          Thank you Pawfect Match. You are doing a good deed by 
          taking care of so many animals until they find a home.”

          instantly connected during the playtime I 
          had with her at the center and I knew 
          that she was the one. So grateful to 
          Pawfect Match for their all in one service 
          of providing animal care products and 
          training on proper care and management 
          on top of adoption, that are immensely 
          helpful for first-time adopters like me.”

          has never left my side ever since then. 
          Keep up the great work Pawfect Match. 
          Your animal care products and training
